# Food Menu Design

## Design Concept
In this project, we have created a visually appealing food menu design that combines three primary colors: red mixed with brown, black, and a touch of light orange. The goal was to create a warm and inviting visual experience that would resonate with customers and stimulate their appetite.

## Design Elements

### Color Palette
- **Red:** The primary color used to grab attention and evoke feelings of hunger and excitement.
- **Brown:** A complementary color that adds warmth and richness to the design, symbolizing the comfort of home-cooked meals.
- **Black:** Used for text and accents, providing contrast and readability.
- **Light Orange:** A subtle and complementary color that adds a touch of freshness and energy to the design.

### Imagery
We have chosen to use real-life food images instead of vector illustrations for a more authentic and realistic look. This decision was made to help customers visualize the actual dishes and make informed choices.

### Food Selection
We have carefully selected eight mouthwatering dishes to showcase on the menu. Each dish is accompanied by a brief description and its price to provide customers with essential information.
